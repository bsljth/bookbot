## bookbot
bookbot is a guided project that I had to do for the [boot.dev](https://boot.dev) back-end engineering online coding bootcamp.

Bookbot reads a `.txt` file and processes the text for specific information such as counting the number of words in the text, the number of times each English alphabet occurs in the text etc.

To run this project, simply clone this repo and run:
```
$ cd bookbot
```

```
$ python main.py
```
or depending on your operating system, run:
```
$ python3 main.py
```

You can also use [Codon](https://github.com/exaloop/codon) to compile a binary of the file like this:
```
$ codon build main.py
```

and run the program like this:
```
$ ./main
```

or if you are on Windows:
```
$ ./main.exe
```
